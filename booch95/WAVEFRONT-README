This is the Wavefront directory of the Ada 95 Booch Components.

The Components are available in three forms:

bc-{date}.tar.gz, normally for UNIX systems

  tar zxvf bc-{date}.tar.gz
  zcat bc-{date}.tar.gz | tar xvf -

bc-{date}.zip,    normally for Windows 95 (long file names)

  use WinZip or equivalent (has CR/LF line terminations)

bc-{date}.src,    uncompressed concatenated source, for DOS/Windows 3

  use the GNAT utility gnatchop to extract the sources and crunch
  the file names to 8.3 form.

  GNAT can be obtained from ftp://cs.nyu.edu/pub/gnat and mirrors.
