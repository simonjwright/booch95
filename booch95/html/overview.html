Please note that this web page is a work-in-progress. Some documentation,
commentaries, statistics, source code, etc. will change over the course
of time. If anything is updated on the Booch Components, you'll see it here
first, so be sure to check from time to time.<p>

To help, there's a registration facility for the <a

<H2>History</H2>

<p>The Ada 95 Booch Components began in late 1994 when <a
href=mailto="dweller@riva.com">David Weller</a> began a port of
Grady Booch's C++ components.</p>

<p>A first beta release was soon available, followed by a release in
February 1997.</p>

<p>In December of that year, David concluded that he wouldn't be able
to continue with the Components and appealed on the <A
HREF="http://www.adahome.com/FAQ/team-ada.html">Team Ada</A>
mailing list for a volunteer. Having already found the Components very
useful, I got my employers' permission to take them on (not a speedy
process); work began 18.vii.98.</p>

<p>Storage Management was added in August 1998 by
<a href="mailto:pat@classwide.com">Pat Rogers</a>, thanks very much
Pat!  (you may like to visit <a href="http://www.classwide.com">Pat's
web site</a>).

<H2>Schedule</H2>

<p>(Please note, the Components are likely to change fairly
dramatically between releases over the next few iterations. You'll
probably need to change your source at each issue; you'll certainly
need to recompile).</p>

<P>The current version has the following components available (the
<font color=red>red</font> parts are new since the last release):</P>

<UL>
<li>Directed Graphs
<li>Undirected Graphs
<LI>Single Lists 
<LI>Double Lists
<li><font color=red>Bounded Maps</font>
<li><font color=red>Dynamic Maps</font>

<dt>Iterators</dt>

<dd>

I've reworked Iteration throughout.<p>

For active iterators, the new style uses a "factory" function
<tt>New_Iterator</tt>, which dispatches on the concrete Container and
returns an Iterator. This uses the fact that tagged types are passed
by reference to allow a reference to the concrete Container to be kept
behind the scenes.<p>

You can see an example of this style in <tt>Map_Test</tt>;

<pre>
  procedure Test_Active_Iterator (M : in out Maps.Map'Class) is
    use Containers; use Maps; use MB;
    Iter : Containers.Iterator := New_Iterator (M);
  begin
    while not Containers.Is_Done (Iter) loop
      Put_Line ("      Item: "
                & Containers.Current_Item (Iter)
                & " Value: "
                & Image (Maps.Current_Value (Iter).all));
      Containers.Next (Iter);
    end loop;
  end Test_Active_Iterator;
</pre>

Passive iteration is handled via generics. In the same test,

<pre>
  procedure Test_Passive_Iterator (M : in out Maps.Map'Class) is
    procedure Visitor is new Maps.Visit (Process, M);
  begin
    Visitor;
  end Test_Passive_Iterator;
</pre>

Note, however, that <b><font color="red">iteration is broken</font>
under GNAT 3.10p!</b> <b><font color="blue">Please use GNAT 3.11p (or
later)</font></b>.<p>

</dd>

<dt>Hierarchy and Graphs</dt>

<dd>

Most of the Components are derived from
<tt>BC.Containers.Container</tt> (and are in packages that are
children of <tt>BC.Containers</tt>). The only feature common at this
level is iteration; implicit in the fact that
<tt>BC.Containers</tt> is a generic package parameterised by the type
<tt>Item</tt> is that Containers contain just one sort of thing.<p>

This works fine except for Graphs; a Graph is a collection of Vertices
(OK so far), while Vertices are connected by (not collections of)
Arcs. Unless I can think of a sensible way of doing things, Graphs
will remain outside the Containers hierarchy.<p>

That said, I've tried to use a common style throughout.<p>
