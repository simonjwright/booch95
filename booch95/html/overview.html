Please note that this web page is a work-in-progress. Some documentation,
commentaries, statistics, source code, etc. will change over the course
of time. If anything is updated on the Booch Components, you'll see it here
first, so be sure to check from time to time.<p>

<p>The Ada 95 Booch Components began in late 1994 when <a
href="mailto:dgweller@despammed.com">David Weller</a> began a port of
Grady Booch's C++ components.</p>

<p>A first beta release was soon available, followed by a release in
February 1997.</p>

<p>In December of that year, David concluded that he wouldn't be able
to continue with the Components and appealed on the <A
HREF="http://www.adahome.com/FAQ/team-ada.html">Team Ada</A>
mailing list for a volunteer. Having already found the Components very
useful, I got my employers' permission to take them on (not a speedy
process); work began 18.vii.98.</p>

<p>Storage Management was added in August 1998 by
<a href="mailto:pat@classwide.com">Pat Rogers</a>, thanks very much
Pat!  (you may like to visit <a href="http://www.classwide.com">Pat's
web site</a>).

<h2><a name="tests">Tests</a>, demonstrations and contributions</h2>

The Components are tested with GNAT. I try hard not to release
anything that doesn't work with the latest public version.<p>

I also use the Aonix ObjectAda compiler (the Special Edition;
currently I am stuck at 7.2, because of some DLL hell which prevents
7.2.1 from working! I wouldn't regard a problem with OA as a
<em>very</em> good reason for withholding a feature, though.<p>

The Components come with <a href="demos.html">test and demonstration
code samples</a>.<p>

There is also a collection of <a href="contrib/">contributions</a>.

<h2><a name="issues">Issues</a></h2>

<p>Please feel free to <a href="mailto:simon@pushface.org">mail
me</a> with any thoughts you may have!</p>

<dl>

<dt>Lists; to use or not to use?</dt>

<dd>

Many people, faced with the BCs for the first time, choose Lists
(Single or Double) as their standard Container.

<p>This is probably <em>not</em> the best choice. Lists are complex
entities which, I suppose, would be useful if you were implementing a
list-processing engine like Lisp.

<p><font color="red">You'll be a lot better off using
Collections!</font>

<p>

</dd>

<dt>Hierarchy, Graphs and Trees</dt>

<dd>

Most of the Components are derived from
<tt>BC.Containers.Container</tt> (and are in packages that are
children of <tt>BC.Containers</tt>). The only feature common at this
level is iteration; implicit in the fact that
<tt>BC.Containers</tt> is a generic package parameterised by the type
<tt>Item</tt> is that Containers contain just one sort of thing.<p>

This works fine except for Graphs; a Graph is a collection of Vertices
(OK so far), while Vertices are connected by (not collections of)
Arcs. Unless I can think of a sensible way of doing things, Graphs
will remain outside the Containers hierarchy.<p>

Although Trees come under the Container hierarchy, they aren't
Containers.  This is largely because of the difficulty of supporting
standard Iterators in a non-linear structure like a Tree.<p>

That said, I've tried to use a common style throughout.<p>

</dd>

<dt>Compilers</dt>

<dd>

The new Aonix ObjectAda 7.2 demo compiler handles the stock Components
without change, so the old "Aonix-only" versions of the test programs,
which omitted Dynamic forms, are no longer needed.

<p>The Components work well (for me) with GCC-3.2 and prerelease 3.3
compilers.
