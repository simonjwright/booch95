<P>(Please note that this web page is a work-in-progress. Some documentation,
commentaries, statistics, source code, etc. will change over the course
of time. If anything is updated on the Booch Components, you'll see it here
first, so be sure to check from time to time.) </P>

<H2>History</H2>

<p>The Ada 95 Booch Components began in late 1994 when <a
href=mailto="dweller@riva.com">David Weller</a> began a port of
Grady Booch's C++ components.</p>

<p>A first beta release was soon available, followed by a release in
February 1997.</p>

<p>In December of that year, David concluded that he wouldn't be able
to continue with the Components and appealed on the <A
HREF="http://www.adahome.com/FAQ/team-ada.html">Team Ada</A>
mailing list for a volunteer. Having already found the Components very
useful, I got my employers' permission to take them on (not a speedy
process); work began 18.vii.98.</p>

<p>Storage Management was added in August 1998 by
<a href="mailto:pat@classwide.com">Pat Rogers</a>, thanks very much
Pat!  (you may like to visit <a href="http://www.classwide.com">Pat's
web site</a>).

<H2>Schedule</H2>

<p>(Please note, the Components are likely to change fairly
dramatically between releases over the next few iterations. You'll
probably need to change your source at each issue; you'll certainly
need to recompile).</p>

<P>The version to be released will have the following components
available (the <font color=red>red</font> parts are new since David's
last release):</P>

<UL>
<LI>Bounded Stacks 
<LI>Dynamic Stacks
<LI>Unbounded Stacks

<dt>Iterators</dt>

<dd>
The current <tt>BC.Containers</tt> generic requires both the
<tt>Item</tt> and an accessor (<tt>Item_Ptr</tt>) as parameters.<br>

I found this very awkward when the type I was interested in was
<tt>limited private</tt> (and I therefore had to create an accessor
anyway, because the Components require a copyable type).<br>

The need for the pointer type arises from the C++ iterators that give
a reference to the <tt>Item</tt>, so you can modify the contained
<tt>Item</tt> rather than a copy of it: we have both of

<pre>
  function Current_Item (Obj : Iterator) return Item_Ptr;
</pre>

and

<pre>
  generic
    with procedure Apply (Elem_Ref : in Item_Ptr; OK : out Boolean);
  function Modify (Obj : access Passive_Iterator) return Boolean;
</pre>

My thought is to replace the "<tt>in Item_Ptr</tt>"s by "<tt>in out
Item</tt>"s.<br>

This means we need either a generic or a procedure access parameter (I
think the latter will be impossible; either we'll be taking the access
at too low a level, or we'll find ourselves wanting to take
<tt>'Access</tt> of a procedure inside a generic where the type was
declared outside ..)
