Please note that this web page is a work-in-progress. Some documentation,
commentaries, statistics, source code, etc. will change over the course
of time. If anything is updated on the Booch Components, you'll see it here
first, so be sure to check from time to time.<p>

To help, there's a registration facility for the <a
href="http://www.netmind.com/">NetMind</a> Mind-it service on the <a
href="release.html">Release Notes</a> page.

<H2>History</H2>

<p>The Ada 95 Booch Components began in late 1994 when <a
href=mailto="dweller@riva.com">David Weller</a> began a port of
Grady Booch's C++ components.</p>

<p>A first beta release was soon available, followed by a release in
February 1997.</p>

<p>In December of that year, David concluded that he wouldn't be able
to continue with the Components and appealed on the <A
HREF="http://www.adahome.com/FAQ/team-ada.html">Team Ada</A>
mailing list for a volunteer. Having already found the Components very
useful, I got my employers' permission to take them on (not a speedy
process); work began 18.vii.98.</p>

<p>Storage Management was added in August 1998 by
<a href="mailto:pat@classwide.com">Pat Rogers</a>, thanks very much
Pat!  (you may like to visit <a href="http://www.classwide.com">Pat's
web site</a>).

dramatically between releases over the next few iterations. You'll
probably need to change your source at each issue; you'll certainly
need to recompile).</p>

<dt>Iterators</dt>

<dd>

I've reworked Iteration throughout.<p>

For active iterators, the new style uses a "factory" function
<tt>New_Iterator</tt>, which dispatches on the concrete Container and
returns an Iterator. This uses the fact that tagged types are passed
by reference to allow a reference to the concrete Container to be kept
behind the scenes.<p>

You can see an example of this style in <tt>Stack_Test</tt>;

<pre>
  procedure Test_Active_Iterator (S : Container'Class) is
    Iter : Iterator'Class := New_Iterator (C);
    Success : Boolean;
    Temp : Character;
  begin
    while not Is_Done (Iter) loop
      Temp := Current_Item (Iter);
      Process (Temp, Success);
      Next (Iter);
    end loop;
  end Test_Active_Iterator;
</pre>

Passive iteration is handled via generics. In the same test, we have

<pre>
  procedure Test_Passive_Iterator (S : Container'Class) is
    procedure Iterate is new Visit (Apply => Process);
    Iter : Iterator'Class := New_Iterator (S);
  begin
    Iterate (Using => Iter);
  end Test_Passive_Iterator;
</pre>

Note, however, that <b><font color="red">iteration is broken</font>
under GNAT 3.10p!</b> <b><font color="blue">Please use GNAT 3.11p (or
later)</font></b>.<p>

</dd>

<dt>Hierarchy, Graphs and Trees</dt>

<dd>

Most of the Components are derived from
<tt>BC.Containers.Container</tt> (and are in packages that are
children of <tt>BC.Containers</tt>). The only feature common at this
level is iteration; implicit in the fact that
<tt>BC.Containers</tt> is a generic package parameterised by the type
<tt>Item</tt> is that Containers contain just one sort of thing.<p>

This works fine except for Graphs; a Graph is a collection of Vertices
(OK so far), while Vertices are connected by (not collections of)
Arcs. Unless I can think of a sensible way of doing things, Graphs
will remain outside the Containers hierarchy.<p>

Although Trees come under the Container hierarchy, they aren't
Containers.  This is largely because of the difficulty of supporting
standard Iterators in a non-linear structure like a Tree.<p>

That said, I've tried to use a common style throughout.<p>

</dd>

<dt>Synchronization</dt>

<dd>

As discussed <a href="documentation.html#synchronization">elsewhere</a>,
there are two forms of support for concurrency:

<dl>
<dt>guarded<dd>where objects must be locked by the client, and
<dt>synchronized<dd>where each operation provides its own internal locking
</dl>

Some <em>synchronized</em> objects additionally provide a form of
queuing control; an attempt to read from an empty Container will
result in blocking until an entry is added to the Container.<p>

</dd>

<dt>Compilers</dt>

<dd>

I've been looking at adding concurrency support to Maps. This has
turned up some GNAT problems, which I've reported, and has pretty well
blown the Aonix ObjectAda 7.1 demo compiler out of the water (it has
trouble with AVL Trees too). I understand from Aonix that they're
considering a demo version of the latest compiler release; until then,
support for newer BC features under OA will be low-priority.<p>
