Added Maps.<p>

Reworked Iteration throughout. <em><font color="red">These changes
will break existing code</font></em>; <a
href="compiler-problems.html#3jan1999">compiler problems</a> mean
that <em>you can't use GNAT 3.10p</em> (well, not if you need
iteration).<p>

</dd>

<dt>20 October 1998</dt>

<dd>

Added Graphs. There are more <a
href="compiler-problems.html#20oct1998">compiler problems</a>, I'm
afraid, though we have found a workround for one of the old ones.<p>

Internal changes in Storage Management.<p>

</dd>

<dt>6 October 1998</dt>

<dd>

Updated notes on <a href="compiler-problems.html#6oct1998">compiler

Storage Management added, thanks to <a
href="mailto:pat@classwide.com">Pat Rogers</a>. This has tickled some
<em><font color="red">compiler problems</font></em>, <a
href="compiler-problems.html">please check to see if you're
affected</a>.<p>

Fixed inefficiency in Unbounded (and perhaps Dynamic) forms of Queues
and Stacks.<p>

Storage Management for Dynamic and Unbounded forms required that we
instantiate some support packages inside the using generic rather than
having the user pre-instantiate them. We decided to adopt the same
policy for Bounded forms too. <em><font color="red">These changes will
break existing code.</font></em><p>

Added some comments to package specs.<p>

Added some minor demo code (<tt>storage</tt>, <tt>time_lists</tt> and
<tt>time_queues</tt>).<p>

</dd>

<dt>24 August 1998</dt>

<dd>Bugfix release.<p>

There were several storage leaks.<p>

It's illegal to declare abstract subprograms in a private part.<p>

The Stack and Queue iterators were broken (by sjw).<p>

First release by <a href="mailto:simon@pogner.demon.co.uk">Simon
