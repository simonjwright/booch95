Included the accidentally-omitted Bounded and Dynamic Bag sources.<p>

<dd>

<dt>4th May 1999</dt>

<dd>

Added Bounded and Dynamic Bags.<p>

Added Unbounded Rings in standard, Guarded and Synchronized forms.<p>

ObjectAda <a href="compiler-problems.html#4may1999">problems</a> with
Semaphores.<p>

<dt>14th March 1999</dt>

<dd>
Eliminated a problem where a function call, used only for its side
effect and not for its result, was deleted by high optimisation
levels (<tt>-O3</tt>).<p>

Passive iteration (in <tt>BC.Containers</tt>) didn't reset the
passed-in <tt>Iterator</tt>.<p>

<a href="compiler-problems.html#13mar1999">Notes</a> from <a
href="mailto:woodruff1@llnl.gov">John P. Woodruff</a> on use with
Rational Apex.<p>

Added a word-counter demo, as suggested by <a
href="mailto:J.English@bton.ac.uk">John English</a> in the <a
href="http://www.suffix.com/Ada/SCL/">Ada Standard Component Library
Working Group</a>.<p>

Further <a href="contrib/">contributions</a>.<p>

</dd>

<dt>21st February 1999</dt>

<dd>
Containers require a (defaultable) <tt>"="</tt> operation for
Items.<p>

Added Bags (only in the Unbounded form so far).<p>

Added Sets.<p>

Reworked Iteration; passive iteration now obtains the Container over
which to iterate via an Iterator bound to the container. This allows
different styles of iteration with one interface.<p>
 
Graphs have three Vertex iterators: incoming only, outgoing only, both
ways.<p>

Binary trees have in-order, pre-order and post-order iterators;
Multiway trees have pre-order and post-order iterators. Only passive
iteration is available, and the style is different from that of other
Containers.<p>

If a section of a list which didn't contain a shared node was purged,
an invalid pointer access (Constraint_Error) would occur. This error
was in the C++ (where it was OK, it seems, to <tt>free()</tt> a null
pointer).<p>

Assignment involving unbounded forms didn't correctly invalidate the
cache in the copy.<p>

Began a <a href="demos.html">demos</a> page.<p>

Began a <a href="contrib/">"contributions"</a> section, with
initial contributions from <a
href="mailto:Daniel.Gaudry@wanadoo.fr">Daniel Gaudry</a>.<p>

</dd>

<dt>29 January 1999</dt>

<dd>
Corrected an error in AVL trees (only the second one that is an error
in the original C++ and not in the translation!).<p>

Added ObjectAda-special versions of test drivers (avoiding <a
href="compiler-problems.html#29jan1999">compiler problems</a>).<p>

Removed a use of the GNAT-special <tt>'Img</tt> attribute.<p>

Removed a couple of badly-placed <tt>pragma Inline</tt>s.<p>

</dd>

<dt>24 January 1999</dt>

<dd>

Added Maps.<p>

Added AVL Trees.<p>

Removed some abbreviations; for instance, in
<tt>BC.Containers.Stacks.Unbounded</tt>, the type <tt>Unb_Stack</tt>
becomes <tt>Unbounded_Stack</tt>. <em><font color="red">These changes
will break existing code.</font></em><p>

Reworked Iteration throughout, with a <em><font color="green">vast
improvement in the efficiency of List iterators</font></em>. <em><font
color="red">These changes will break existing code</font></em>; <a
href="compiler-problems.html#23jan1999">compiler problems</a> mean
that <em><font color="red">you can't use GNAT 3.10p</font></em>.<p>

Moved Graph iterators up to the parent package (<tt>BC.Graphs</tt>),
and included a little demonstration of Graph usage
(<tt>Ada_Units</tt>).<p>

For consistency, the concrete Graph, Vertex and Arc types are now
prefixed with <tt>Undirected_</tt> or <tt>Directed_</tt> as
appropriate; eg, a directed Vertex becomes
<tt>Directed_Vertex</tt>.<p>

</dd>

<dt>20 October 1998</dt>

<dd>

Added Graphs. There are more <a
href="compiler-problems.html#20oct1998">compiler problems</a>, I'm
afraid, though we have found a workround for one of the old ones.<p>

Internal changes in Storage Management.<p>

</dd>

<dt>6 October 1998</dt>

<dd>

Updated notes on <a href="compiler-problems.html#6oct1998">compiler
problems</a> to give a workround for users of ObjectAda 7.1 Special
Edition.<p>

</dd>

<dt>4 October 1998</dt>

<dd>

Storage Management added, thanks to <a
href="mailto:pat@classwide.com">Pat Rogers</a>. This has tickled some
<em><font color="red">compiler problems</font></em>, <a
href="compiler-problems.html">please check to see if you're
affected</a>.<p>

Fixed inefficiency in Unbounded (and perhaps Dynamic) forms of Queues
and Stacks.<p>

Storage Management for Dynamic and Unbounded forms required that we
instantiate some support packages inside the using generic rather than
having the user pre-instantiate them. We decided to adopt the same
policy for Bounded forms too. <em><font color="red">These changes will
break existing code.</font></em><p>

Added some comments to package specs.<p>

Added some minor demo code (<tt>storage</tt>, <tt>time_lists</tt> and
<tt>time_queues</tt>).<p>

</dd>

<dt>24 August 1998</dt>

<dd>Bugfix release.<p>

There were several storage leaks.<p>

It's illegal to declare abstract subprograms in a private part.<p>

The Stack and Queue iterators were broken (by sjw).<p>

</dd>

<dt>1 August 1998</dt>

<dd>

First release by <a href="mailto:simon@pogner.demon.co.uk">Simon
Wright</a>. Added Binary and Multiway Trees, Smart Pointers.<p>
