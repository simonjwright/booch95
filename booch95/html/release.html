<dt>4 October 1998</dt>

<dd>Storage Management added, thanks to
<a href="mailto:progers@acm.org">Pat Rogers</a>. This has tickled
some <em><font color="red">compiler problems</font></em>, 
<a href="compiler-problems.html">please check to see if you're affected</a>.
<br>Fixed inefficiency in Unbounded (and perhaps Dynamic) forms of
Queues and Stacks.
<br>Storage Management for Dynamic and Unbounded forms required that we
instantiate some support packages inside the using generic rather than
having the user pre-instantiate them. We decided to adopt the same policy
for Bounded forms too. <em><font color="red">These changes will break
existing code.</font></em>
<br>Added some comments to package specs.
<br>Added some minor demo code (<tt>storage</tt>, <tt>time_lists</tt>
and <tt>time_queues</tt>).
</dd>

<dt>24 August 1998</dt>

<dd>Bugfix release.
<br>There were several storage leaks.
<br>It's illegal to declare abstract subprograms in a private part.
<br>The Stack and Queue iterators were broken (by sjw).
</dd>

<dt>1 August 1998</dt>
<dd>First release by <a href="mailto:simon@pogner.demon.co.uk">Simon
