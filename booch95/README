This is the first "public" beta release of the Ada 95 Booch Components.
This reelase (0.4q) contains only the Queue form of the components,
and is currently limited to the sequential (non-concurrent) forms.
Future releases will included more functionality and (hopefully) fewer
bugs.  For now, the components can be downloaded from
ftp.dfw.net://pub/users/dweller.  The file will be named
bcDDMMYY.tar.gz (where DD=Day, MM=Month, YY=Year).  For users that are
running Microsoft(tm) DOS below version 7 (commonly called "Windows
95"), you need to download the file bcDDMMYY.zip.

For a complete list of known bugs, please read the Openbugs.txt file
found in this release.
