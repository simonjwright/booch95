This release of the Booch Components runs with the following
compilers: 

    Aonix ObjectAda 7.1 (not sure about 7.0) 
    SGI Ada 95 v1.2 

This release currently does NOT work with the following compilers: 

    GNU Ada 95 Compiler (GNAT v3.09).  Bug report has been submitted.

This beta release contains the following components: 

    Stacks 
        Bounded 
        Dynamic 
        Unbounded 
    Queues 
        Bounded 
        Dynamic 
        Unbounded 
    Lists 
        Single 
        Double 

Each form has a test program associated with it (list_test.adb,
stack_test.adb, queue_test.adb).  Use those programs as an example of
proper usage of
the components. 

Please note that these components are considered a work-in-progress.
As such, generic parameters, subprogram profiles, and other things may
change that may impact your software.  We will take the greatest steps
possible to ensure this is not a problem. 

Note that assertions, which are supported with both Aonix ObjectAda
and the GNU Ada compiler, are used in this software.  If your program
fails for an unknown reason, recompile with assertions turned on and run
again.
