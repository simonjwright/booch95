# Determine the prefix of the GNAT system to which the current
# 'gnatmake' belongs and use it to edit Makefile.in and create a
# Makefile that will install the BCs in that system.

# We need to go via gnatmake because the compiler driver is sometimes
# just 'gcc' and sometimes 'gnatgcc'.

# eg /opt/gcc-4.6.0-x86_64/lib/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin10/4.6.0/libgcc.a
libgcc=`gnatmake -c -u -f -gnats src/bc.ads -cargs -print-libgcc-file-name 2>/dev/null`
# eg /opt/gcc-4.6.0-x86_64/lib/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin10/4.6.0
versiondir=`dirname $libgcc`
# eg x86_64-apple-darwin10
builddir=`(cd $versiondir/..; echo $PWD)`
build=`basename $builddir`
