anh-vo/ contains storage managers from Anh Vo <Anh.Vo@udlp.com>. He
said
   "I would like to suggest some improvement in the area of Storage
   Pool.  The implementation of Storage Pool attached is simpler, more
   efficient.  Most of all, it can detect memory leaks. There are two
   kinds of Storage Pool, general and fix. Fixed Storage Pool is
   several times more efficient than General Storage Pool due to the
   fixed size of the data."
