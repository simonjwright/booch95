   --  A directed graph is an unrooted collection of vertices and
   --  directed arcs where cycles and cross-references are not
   --  permitted. An undirected graph is an unrooted collection of
   --  vertices and undirected arcs where cycles and cross-references
   --  are permitted. Three types collaborate to form the abstraction
   --  of a directed and undirected graph: a graph type, a vertex
   --  type, and an arc type.

   --  Directed and undirected graphs are monolithic structures
   --  although copying, assignment, and equality are
   --  prohibited. Their vertices and arcs are polylithic structures,
   --  and hence the semantics of copying, assignment, and equality
   --  involve structural sharing. Care must be taken in manipulating
   --  the same vertex or arc named by more than one alias.

   --  These classes are not intended to be subclassed.

   --  These abstractions have been carefully constructed to eliminate
   --  all storage leaks, except in the case of intentional
   --  abuses. When a graph is manipulated, all items that become
   --  unreachable are automatically reclaimed. Furthermore, this
   --  design protects against dangling references: an item is never
   --  reclaimed if there exists a reference to it.

   --  Each vertex and arc is a member of exactly one graph;
   --  furthermore, the vertices at both ends of an arc are guaranteed
   --  to be members of the same graph as the arc. This guarantee is
   --  provided by an implementation strategy whereby every graph is
   --  given a unique identity, and each vertex and arc is created
   --  only in the context of a particular graph.

   --  Note that objects of type Vertex, Arc are handles or references
   --  to the actual Graph components.

   --  Note that Containers contain just one sort of Item; Graphs
   --  aren't therefore Containers.
