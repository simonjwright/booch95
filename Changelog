This is the Changelog for the Booch Components. It's intended for
updating SourceForge releases, not as a standard ChangeLog; in other

the 20070822 and 20090216 releases.

20090226:

A release with fixes for Ring containers.	

There was a problem when the Mark denoted an internal index before the
Top; Insert would improperly increment the Mark.

yyyymmdd:

A release with ...

There was a problem with BC.Support.High_Resolution_Time on 64-bit
compilers. Cleared by doing the Right Thing and using
Unchecked_Conversion instead of overlays.
