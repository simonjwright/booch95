This is the Changelog for the Booch Components. It's intended for
updating SourceForge releases, not as a standard ChangeLog; in other
words, it's for features, not detailed updates, and it's for features
actually in releases - it excludes work-in-progress.

Paste into the Change Log box; at present you need to 'preserve my
preformatted text', see SF Support Requests item #2624497.

80-column width works well.

The final entry is intended as catch-up for the changes made between
the 20070822 and 20090216 releases.

yyyymmdd:

A release with ...

There was a problem with BC.Support.High_Resolution_Time on 64-bit
compilers. Cleared by doing the Right Thing and using
Unchecked_Conversion instead of overlays.

On Mac OS X Snow Leopard, BC.Support.High_Resolution_Time failed
because the OS stops the Time Stamp Counter while the processor is
sleeping. Fortunately, on this OS, the resolution of the system clock
is 1 microsecond, so an implementation is provided that uses
Ada.Calendar.Time.

pragmas Pure and Preelaborate used where possible.

Indefinite_Reference.Adjust failed if the Pointer was null (this
happened wtih Null_Container).

20090226:

A release with fixes for Ring containers.

There was a problem when the Mark denoted an internal index before the
Top; Insert would improperly increment the Mark.

20090216:

A release with some fixes for MacOS.

Altered the directory structure to a more standard form; the top level
is still bc-yyyymmdd, but under that is GNAT/ (supporting GNUAda and
other Ada projects on SourceForge), src/ for source, tests/ for tests
and demos/ for demos.
