<dd>GNAT 3.12 won't accept
<pre>
   type T is access Integer;
   Pool : System.Storage_Pools.Root_Storage_Pool
     renames T'Storage_Pool;
</pre>
Instead, you have to use <tt>T'Storage_Pool</tt> directly.</dd>
<dt><a name="31jan2002">16 January 2002</a></dt>
<dd><tt>User_Map</tt> (in <a href=
"overview.html#tests">Demonstrations</a>) fails in
BC.Support.Managed_Storage while deallocating memory in a
finalization procedure. Not sure why, investigations say that the
pool was OK the previous time it was looked at ..</dd>

<dd><tt>BC.Copy</tt>, <tt>BC.Filter</tt> can't be used under
ObjectAda 7.2, AdaMULTI 3.1 or Apex 3.0.0b; they think the
<pre>
  with package Source is new BC.Containers (Item);
</pre>
is illegal because it derives from a controlled type at other than
library level. Tucker Taft says they are wrong.</dd>

<dd>ObjectAda 7.2 can't compile <tt>sort_test.adb</tt> (internal
failure).</dd>
<dt><a name="13aug2000">13 August 2000</a></dt>
<dd>The new work on providing Synchronized and Guarded forms has
thrown up a disagreement between compilers.
<p>GNAT 3.12, APEX NT 3.0.2b and Aonix 7.2 get very confused; GNAT
3.13 is happy.</p>
<p>You can see an approximation to the code <a href=

<dt><a name="29may1999">29 May 1999</a></dt>
<dd>A procedure and a protected type entry in the same scope had
the same name; you can't rely on the fact that only entries can
have <tt>'Caller</tt> applied.
<p>GNAT 3.11p was (incorrectly) resolving the name; it should be
qualified with the protected type's name.</p>
<p>See <tt>bc-support-synchronization.adb</tt>

reports problems building the last few releases of the Components
with the Rational Apex compiler.
<p>He reported the compiler defect to Rational, and they have
issued a patch. As patched, Apex 3.0.0b now does compile the entire
suite correctly.</p>
<p>The Apex version needed has the following version mark:</p>

<dt>Iterators</dt>
<dd>The new Iterators work correctly under GNAT 3.11p and ObjectAda
Special Edition Version 7.1.</dd>
<dt>ObjectAda Special Edition Version 7.1</dt>
<dd>There are special versions of the Map, Queue and Stack test
drivers which avoid using the Dynamic forms:
<pre>
map_test_aonix.adb
queue_test_aonix.adb
stack_test_aonix.adb
</pre>
Don't use the test driver <tt>storage.adb</tt>.</dd>

<dd>The new Iterators break GNAT 3.10p. 3.11b is OK, so with any
luck the forthcoming 3.11p will be too!</dd>
<dt>ObjectAda Special Edition Version 7.1 and Dynamic forms</dt>

<dt>Graph passive iterators</dt>
<dd>The passive iterators in <tt>BC.Graphs.Directed</tt> and
<tt>BC.Graphs.Undirected</tt> break GNAT 3.10p and 3.11a1. 3.11b is
OK, so with any luck the forthcoming 3.11p will be too!</dd>
<dt>ObjectAda Special Edition Version 7.1 and Dynamic
forms</dt>
<dd>We have an update on this; the impression is that OA has
trouble with unconstrained types being allocated on a user-supplied
storage pool. The dynamic forms use an unconstrained array for
storage.<br />
(As a note, the dynamic forms aren't as efficient as Grady Booch
intended, because of a code translation problem! this will be
addressed ...)</dd>
<dt>ObjectAda Special Edition Version 7.1 and Managed
Store</dt>
<dd>We've supplied a new version of
<tt>BC.Support.Managed_Storage</tt> which compiles under OA.</dd>
<dt>ObjectAda Special Edition Version 7.1 and
<tt>Graph_Test</tt></dt>
<dd>The compiler fails (internal assertion failure) while compiling
Graph_Test. However, the demo program Ada_Units works as
intended.</dd>

<dd>When <a href="mailto:pat@classwide.com">Pat Rogers</a> added
Storage Management, we found problems with different compilers. I
guess this is an area of the language that's not been very heavily
used up to now.<br />
<dl>
<dt>GNAT 3.10p</dt>
<dd>No problems.</dd>
<dt>GNAT 3.11a1</dt>
<dd>No problems.</dd>
<dt>GNAT 3.11b</dt>
<dd><tt>BC.Support.Unmanaged_Storage</tt> failed to compile.<br />
We've worked round the problem by a (nugatory) view conversion from
what should have been a classwide attribute value already
(<tt>'Storage_Pool</tt>).</dd>
<dt><b>ObjectAda Special Edition Version 7.1</b></dt>
<dd><tt>BC.Support.Managed_Storage</tt> fails to compile.<br />
<tt>BC.Support.Unmanaged_Storage</tt> compiles but the resulting
programs generate exceptions during elaboration of Dynamic forms of
Stacks, Queues.<br />
We don't yet have workrounds for these, so for the time being
ObjectAda users should avoid using Managed Storage and Dynamic
forms with this release (if you want to help find a solution/our
mistake, though, please feel free!)</dd>
