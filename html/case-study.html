<h2><a name="which-components" id="which-components">Which
components to use?</a></h2>
<p>You're clearly going to need some sort of container to implement
Fleet.</p>
<p>If you just want a standard container to support iteration,
filtering and sorting, use Collections. <b>The List components are
much more complex than you'll need.</b></p>
<p><a href="#maps">Later</a>, we'll look at Maps.</p>
<h2><a name="instantiation" id="instantiation">How do I instantiate
them?</a></h2>
<h3><a name="separate-instantiation" id=
"separate-instantiation">Separate instantiation</a></h3>
<p>The first thing to do is to instantiate the top-level abstract
Containers for Car. Note, you have to supply an equality operator
(<tt>"="</tt>) for <tt>Car</tt>; you could also just <tt>use
Cars</tt>.</p>
<pre>
   with BC.Containers;
   with Cars;
   package Abstract_Car_Containers
   is new BC.Containers (Cars.Car, "=" =&gt; Cars."=");
</pre>
<p>Next, using the new Abstract_Car_Containers, instantiate the
abstract Collections. This is quite confusing the first few times
you come across it!</p>

<p>When you instantiate a generic parent like <tt>BC.Containers</tt>, all the generic children of the generic parent become candidates for instantiation as actual children of the actual parent.</p>

<p>Although you have to <tt>with BC.Containers.Collections;</tt>, the
thing you have to instantiate now is the <em>newly
magicked</em> <tt>Abstract_Car_Containers.Collections</tt>:</p>

<pre>
   with Abstract_Car_Containers;
   with BC.Containers.Collections;
   package Abstract_Car_Collections
   is new Abstract_Car_Containers.Collections;
</pre>
<p>Next, choose the representation to be used for concrete
Collections. To start with, assume that you'll never have more than 30
Cars to deal with. This means that you can use the
<i>Bounded</i> form. Again, what you instantiate is the child of
the newly instantiated <tt>Abstract_Car_Collections</tt>.</p>
<pre>
   with Abstract_Car_Collections;
   with BC.Containers.Collections.Bounded;
   package Fleets
   is new Abstract_Car_Collections.Bounded (Maximum_Size =&gt; 30);
</pre>
You now need to create your Fleet:
<pre>
   with Fleets;
   package My_Fleet is

      The_Fleet : Fleets.Collection;

   end My_Fleet;
</pre>
<h3>Grouped instantiation</h3>
<p>You might find it more convenient to do the instantiations in
one place. Note the <tt>use type Cars.Car;</tt> to make
<tt>Car</tt> equality visible:</p>
<pre>
   with BC.Containers.Collections.Bounded;
   with Cars;
   package <a name="fleet-combined" id=
"fleet-combined">My_Fleet_Combined</a> is

      use type Cars.Car;

      package Abstract_Car_Containers
      is new BC.Containers (Cars.Car);

      package Abstract_Car_Collections
      is new Abstract_Car_Containers.Collections;

      package Fleets
      is new Abstract_Car_Collections.Bounded (Maximum_Size =&gt; 30);

      The_Fleet : Fleets.Collection;

   end My_Fleet_Combined;
</pre>
<p>or even to make the use of the Components private:</p>
<pre>
   with BC.Containers.Collections.Bounded;
   with Cars;
   package <a name="fleet-hidden" id=
"fleet-hidden">My_Fleet_Hidden</a> is

      --  subprograms to add, find, and delete Cars

   private

      package Abstract_Car_Containers
      is new BC.Containers (Cars.Car, "=" =&gt; Cars."=");

      package Abstract_Car_Collections
      is new Abstract_Car_Containers.Collections;

      package Fleets
      is new Abstract_Car_Collections.Bounded (Maximum_Size =&gt; 30);

      The_Fleet : Fleets.Collection;

   end My_Fleet_Hidden;
</pre>
<h2><a name="what-to-do" id="what-to-do">What can I do with
them?</a></h2>
<p>Aside from keeping things in Collections, there are other
possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#iteration">iteration</a>,</li>
<li><a href="#selection">selection</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="#sorting">sorting</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="iteration" id="iteration">Iteration</a></h3>
<p>Iteration is the process of visiting each member of a collection
and doing something with or to it.</p>
<p>Two forms of iteration are supported: open and closed. Both
require the creation of Iterators.</p>
<p>With open iterators, you explicitly advance the iterator to the
next element in the collection it references, until it's done; with
closed iterators, you supply a procedure which gets called for each
element in the collection.</p>
<p>Considering the packages declared in the discussion on <a href=
"#separate-instantiation">separate instantiation</a> above, the
operations on iterators are all defined in
<tt>Abstract_Car_Containers</tt>, while actual iterators can only
be created by the concrete package:</p>
<pre>
   declare

      It : Abstract_Car_Containers.Iterator'Class
        := Fleets.New_Iterator (The_Fleet);

   begin

      while not Abstract_Car_Containers.Is_Done (It) loop

         declare
            C : Car := Abstract_Car_Containers.Current_Item (It);
         begin
            null;  --  do something with C
         end;

         Abstract_Car_Containers.Next (It);

      end loop;

   end;
</pre>
<p>A closed-iterator version of the same would look like</p>
<pre>
   declare

      procedure Process_Car (C : Car; OK : out Boolean);

      procedure Process_Fleet
        is new Abstract_Car_Containers.Visit (Process_Car);

      procedure Process_Car (C : Car; OK : out Boolean) is
      begin

         OK := True;  --  unless you want the iteration to stop early

         --  do something with C

      end Process_Car;

      It : Abstract_Car_Containers.Iterator'Class
        := Fleets.New_Iterator (The_Fleet);

   begin

      Process_Fleet (It);

   end;
</pre>
<p>This example uses the generic <tt>Visit</tt>, which takes the
element to be processed as an <tt>in</tt> parameter. As well as
this, there's the generic <tt>Modify</tt>, which takes the element
as an <tt>in out</tt> parameter.</p>
<p>Both <tt>Visit</tt> and <tt>Modify</tt> come in three
flavours:</p>
<ul>
<li>plain</li>
<li>with an additional <tt>in</tt> parameter</li>
<li>with an additional <tt>in out</tt> parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>See <tt>BC.Containers</tt> for details.</p>
<h3><a name="selection" id="selection">Selection</a></h3>
<p>Suppose you want to find all the Cars in our Fleet that were
registered before some date. You could imagine a function
<tt>Registered_Before</tt>:</p>
<pre>
   function Registered_Before
     (Date : Ada.Calendar.Time) return Fleets.Collection;
</pre>
<p>which you'd probably declare in the public part of <a href=
"#fleet-combined"><tt>My_Fleet_Combined</tt></a>. Its body might
look like</p>
<pre>
   function Registered_Before
     (Date : Ada.Calendar.Time) return Fleets.Collection is

      function Wanted (C : Car) return Boolean;

      procedure Choose is new BC.Filter
        (Item =&gt; Car,
         Source =&gt; Abstract_Car_Containers,
         From =&gt; Fleets.Collection,
         Target =&gt; Abstract_Car_Containers,
         To =&gt; Fleets.Collection,
         Pass =&gt; Wanted,
         Clear =&gt; Fleets.Clear,
         Add =&gt; Fleets.Append);

      function Wanted (C : Car) return Boolean is
         use type Ada.Calendar.Time;
      begin
         return C.Registered &lt; Date;
      end Wanted;

      Result : Fleets.Collection;

   begin
      Choose (The_Fleet, Result);
      return Result;
   end Registered_Before;
</pre>
<p>which is a bit of a mouthful.</p>
<p>The tricky bit is the instantiation of <tt>BC.Filter</tt>
(which, of course, you have to <tt>with</tt>):</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><tt>Item</tt></dt>
<dd>is the thing you're filtering (<tt>Car</tt>),</dd>
<dt><tt>Source</tt></dt>
<dd>is an instantion of <tt>BC.Containers</tt> with
<tt>Item</tt>s,</dd>
<dt><tt>From</tt></dt>
<dd>is the concrete Container type which contains the
<tt>Item</tt>s to be filtered; it has to have beeen derived from
the abstract <tt>Container</tt> in <tt>Source</tt>,</dd>
<dt><tt>Target</tt></dt>
<dd>is a (possibly different) instantion of <tt>BC.Containers</tt>
with <tt>Item</tt>s,</dd>
<dt><tt>To</tt></dt>
<dd>is the concrete Container type which is to receive the
<tt>Item</tt>s when they have been filtered; it has to have been
derived from the abstract <tt>Container</tt> in <tt>Target</tt>,
and may or may not be the same as <tt>From</tt>,</dd>
<dt><tt>Pass</tt></dt>
<dd>is a function which takes an <tt>Item</tt> and returns
<tt>True</tt> if it's to be kept. In this case, this is
<tt>Wanted</tt>,</dd>
<dt><tt>Clear</tt></dt>
<dd>is a procedure which empties a <tt>To</tt> Container,</dd>
<dt><tt>Add</tt></dt>
<dd>is a procedure which adds an <tt>Item</tt> to a <tt>To</tt>
Container.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="sorting" id="sorting">Sorting</a></h3>
<p>Suppose you want to keep your Fleet sorted (earliest first). You
need</p>
<pre>
   procedure Sort;
</pre>
<p>which, as before, gets declared in the public part of <a href=
"#fleet-combined"><tt>My_Fleet_Combined</tt></a>.</p>
<pre>
   procedure Sort is

      function Earlier (L, R : Car) return Boolean;

      procedure Sort is new Abstract_Car_Containers.Quicksort
        ("&lt;" =&gt; Earlier,
         Container =&gt; Fleets.Collection,
         Length =&gt; Fleets.Length);

      function Earlier (L, R : Car) return Boolean is
         use type Ada.Calendar.Time;
      begin
         return L.Registered &lt; R.Registered;
      end Earlier;

   begin
      Sort (The_Fleet);
   end Sort;
</pre>
<p>As before, you <tt>with BC.Containers.Quicksort;</tt>, but when
you do the instantiation it's of
<tt>Abstract_Car_Containers.Quicksort</tt>.</p>
<p>As an alternative to Quicksort you can use
<tt>BC.Containers.Shellsort</tt>; the quicksort is (usually)
quicker but uses recursion, so may take more stack space.</p>
<h2><a name="other-components" id="other-components">What other
Components might be useful?</a></h2>
<h3><a name="maps" id="maps">Maps</a></h3>
<p>If you had a lot of Cars to deal with, you might want a
quick-access Container to implement Fleet rather than the
general-purpose Collection.</p>
<p>Quick-access? since all Plates are unique (at any one instant,
anyway. Let's not worry about transferring Plates between Cars!)
you can treat Plate as a unique <i>Key</i> to allow you to find the
Car given the Plate. The Booch Container that does this is the
<i>Map</i>; other container libraries may use other names
(dictionary, associative array are two).</p>
<p>Continuing in the style described in the discussion on <a href=
"#separate-instantiation">separate instantiation</a> above, you
start by creating an Abstract_Car_Maps package:</p>
<pre>
   with Abstract_Car_Containers;
   with BC.Containers.Maps;
   with Cars;
   package Abstract_Car_Maps
   is new Abstract_Car_Containers.Maps (Key =&gt; Cars.Plate_String,
                                        "=" =&gt; Cars.Plate_Strings."=");
</pre>
<p>(this time you can't get away with just <tt>use Cars</tt>).</p>
<p>The Map is implemented using a hash table. You say how many
<i>hash buckets</i> you want, and you supply a <i>hash function</i>
which, given a Key, indicates which bucket is to be used. The
buckets correspond to individual Collection-like containers.</p>
<pre>
   with Cars;
   function Plate_Hash (P : Cars.Plate_String) return Natural;
</pre>
<pre>
   with Abstract_Car_Maps;
   with BC.Containers.Maps.Bounded;
   with Plate_Hash;
   package Mapped_Fleets is new Abstract_Car_Maps.Bounded
     (Hash =&gt; Plate_Hash,
      Buckets =&gt; 5,
      Maximum_Size =&gt; 30);
</pre>
<p>Why does this speed things up? The reason is that, to search a
Collection for a particular element, you need to look at half the
elements on average. If you have a Map with 1000 Cars split among
10 hash buckets, a search will only have to examine 50 Cars on
average rather than the 500 you'd need to look at if you used a
plain Collection.</p>
<p>For this to work properly you do need a good hash function, of
course (<tt>Plate_Hash</tt>). It would be quite legal, but not at all
efficient, for the hash function always to return 0. A set of string
hash functions (part of the author's <a href=
"http://coldframe.sourceforge.net/coldframe">ColdFrame</a> package, a
code framework generator backend for UML CASE tools) is available in
<a href="coldframe-hash.tgz">tar</a> and <a href=
"coldframe-hash.zip">zip</a> forms.</p>
<p>In many applications, you'll probably find the fact that a Map
implements associative lookup as useful as, if not more so than,
the performance aspects.</p>
<p><i>More to come here on Sets and Queues.</i></p>
<h2><a name="forms" id="forms">What are these "Forms"?</a></h2>
<p>Most of the Containers come in four <i>concrete forms</i>,
distinguished by the approach to storage management. The forms
are</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Bounded</i>,</li>
<li><i>Dynamic</i> (deprecated),</li>
<li><i>Unbounded</i>, and</li>
<li><i>Unmanaged</i>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bounded</h3>
<p>We've already come across the Bounded form; you can use it if
you know the maximum number of items you'll need to store.</p>
<p><i>Note on unconstrainedness.</i></p>
<p>The bounded form doesn't allocate memory of itself (of course,
you can use it to hold items that are allocated), so it may be
appropriate for systems where allocation is frowned upon. However,
it can be slower, especially for insertion or deletion "in the
middle".</p>
<p>There is an issue with deletion of items that need finalizing:
the finalization will only occur when the item's storage slot is
overwritten or when the container itself is finalized. Also, if the
item is an access type, <i>you</i> have to manage deallocation.</p>
<h3>Dynamic</h3>
<p>This form was designed before storage pools were properly
understood. You're probably best off not using it.</p>
<h3>Unbounded</h3>
<p>The unbounded form allocates space for each item held from a
storage pool that you provide and returns it when the item is
removed.</p>
<h3>Unmanaged</h3>
<p>The unmanaged form allocates space for each item held from the
system memory pool and returns it when the item is removed. It's by
far the simplest form to use.</p>
<p>The Mapped_Fleets example above would become</p>
<pre>
   with Abstract_Car_Maps;
   with BC.Containers.Maps.Unmanaged;
   with Plate_Hash;
   package Mapped_Fleets is new Abstract_Car_Maps.Unmanaged
     (Hash =&gt; Plate_Hash,
      Buckets =&gt; 5);
</pre>
<p><i>I guess this should cover Storage Management as well.</i></p>
